            <p>
              Austen Higgins-Cassidy can't keep himself away from electronics and microprocessors.
              He's been taking apart devices since 1995: he loves designing PCBs to breakout new and interesting parts, and then using those parts to create new and interesting systems.
              Proficient in <b>C & C++</b> and circuit design, he favors FOSS tools (and is adept at navigating commercial-ready licenses) and software while building personal projects. He occasionally has to bust out the FPGA for some really gnarley <b>Verilog</b> design.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the software side of the equation, Austen prefers working with Ruby, Python, and <b>Typescript</b>. While none of these languages is perfect, each brings a great deal to the table in terms of rapid-prototyping and visualization. He's worked with Rails to generate front-end and backend-tools for hobby projects (mostly revolving around Roleplaying games, one of his biggest hobbies that doesn't involve batteries of some kind). His favorite language is still C/C++, but the older languages can be cumbersome and lead to slow development vs the more agile modern languages.
            </p>
            <h2>
              MISC
            </h2>
            <p>
              While he loves engineering and building electronics, Austen dabbles with 3D printing and physical fabrication. He also engages in more creative endeavors. Writing, reading, board-and-tabletop games, craft beer, skiing, camping, hiking, and data-visualization. He very occasionally finds time to watch a TV show or movie, but would almost always rather be creating than consuming.
