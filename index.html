        ABOUT
      </h2>
      <p>
        Austen Higgins-Cassidy can't keep himself away from electronics. He loves designing PCBs to breakout new and interesting parts, and then using those parts to create new and interesting systems. Proficient in <b>C & C++</b> and circuit design, he favors FOSS tools and software while building personal projects. He occasionally has to bust out the FPGA for some really gnarley <b>Verilog</b> design.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the software side of the equation, Austen prefers working with <b>Ruby</b>, Python, and Javascript. While none of these languages is perfect, each brings a great deal to the table in terms of rapid-prototyping and visualization. He's worked with Rails to generate front-end and backend-tools for hobby projects (mostly revolving around Roleplaying games, one of his biggest hobbies that doesn't involve batteries of some kind). His favorite language is still C/C++, but the older languages can be cumbersome and lead to slow development vs the more agile modern languages.

      <h2>
        MISC
      </h2>
      <p>
        While he loves engineering and building electronics, Austen dabbles with 3D printing and physical fabrication. He also engages in more creative endeavors. Writing, reading, board-and-tabletop games, craft beer, skiing, camping, hiking, and data-visualization. He very occasionally finds time to watch a TV show or movie, but would almost always rather be creating than consuming.
